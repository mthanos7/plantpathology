## Project Basics

The purpose of this project is to develop an image classification model to accurately classify a given leaf image from the test dataset to a particular disease category, and to identify the diseases of a plant from an single leaf image. This model is a multi-classification model, where it acn identify multiple types of diseases on a leaf.

The main components of the app are:

1. **Base** - It consists of a function for users to upload their images, where our application will classify the health of the plant and return the health category of the plant. 

2. **Model** - The image classification moddel is a multi-classification modul, built using Tensorflow.
